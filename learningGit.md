## Basic Git commands
- git init: initializes a new Git repository
- git clone: clones a repository from a remote source to your device
- git add [file': stages a file. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the projeect's history. Staging and committing separately gives developers complete control over the history of the project without changing how they code and work.
- git commit: saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking progress.
- git status: shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
- git branch: shows the branches being worked on locally
- git merge: merges lines of development together. Combines changes made on two distinct branches.
- git pull: merges changes from a remote repository into local repository
- git branch: shows the branches being worked on locally
- git push: updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch
